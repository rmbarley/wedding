    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>

        <h3>How do I get to the venue?</h3>
        <p>
          Mendon is a 50 minute drive from Logan International Airport in
          Boston. It is 40 minutes from smaller airports in Worcester or
          Providence, and 90 minutes from Bradley International in Hartford. If
          you're not planning on renting a car, there are buses and trains that
          will take you part of the way from any of these, but you will have to
          get a cab/Uber/etc. the rest of the way
